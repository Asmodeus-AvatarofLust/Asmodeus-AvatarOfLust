# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Milosh!

### Few things about me

Unlike most of other Github users, I am not that much useful in any way, nor creative.
That's why I'll try and sometimes actually make some random stuff I'm interested in at that very moment.
Those projects, if you can call them that, can and probably will fail eventually, both because I am inexperienced and lazy.
Therefore, things you will find here will mostly be useless junk on their own, but it might spark an idea or help you in some way.

* I am not particularly interested in programming as it is, so I'll rather give the idea without doing stuff on my own
* Those ideas, however, can and probably will be very dumb and useless, but that's to be expected

That summs it up, lads and lasses.
