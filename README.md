# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is Milosh!

### So Basically...

I am an useless member of the society with no clue of what the f*** will I do with my life.
Basically I get inspirations to do random things at random time, for example 3:34am in the f****** morning. 

* I am learning whatever programming language I feel like learning at the said moment, so I won't list any here.
* I made useless things in the past that even I forgot about or deleted in the middle of writting said things.
* I have a talent in coming up with useless stuff that nobody needs in their lives, not even myself, but I still do them.
